R package for Simonsohn et al papers

This is in early development, use is not recommended by others yet.
This will eventually become an R package with functions necessary to implement various methods developed in papers by Uri Simonsohn and colleagues.
It will also include miscelaneous functions not associated with specific papers, such as the first two functions added to the package: `prepare.plot()` and `gam.scatter()`
The package is expected to be officially released (submitted to CRAN) with the publication of the paper "Non-Random Effects", co-authored by Andres Montealegre and Ioannis Evangelidis.
